## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I am proud of how i used chart.js for the graph in the solution. 

Although the solution is not perfect, I think it's pretty good as it's my second problem from frontend-mentor.
